Project exam 1: a blog, «The Food Place»

The purpose of this project was to answer the assignment given in the course Project Exam 1, at the end of the first year of my Front-End studies at Noroff, spring 2023.
The brief said to make a blog, with any theme. I chose a food and lifestyle theme. The use of the website is thought to be for the author/creator to reach out to/keep in contact with her audience, as well as have a single place to keep her digital content across platforms. 


Description

The project is a blog, mostly revolving around a food topic, but also a more general lifestyle theme. Its main purpose is to provide content from the content creator and to her audience, as well as a point of connection between them.

The site is made up of 5 pages:
-A front page
-A contact page
-An about page
-A page listing the blog posts
-A page specific to whatever blog post the user selects

The website is built to be responsive, and look good and thereby be user-friendly on different devices.

The website has a light and earthy design. The olive wood of the header, and the sage of different elements play into the «earthy, slow living» of the brand. White backgrounds and black fonts, makes for a site that is comfortable to read, as the main content is text to be read. 

The blog also utilizes features like a carousel, and modal images, (this is also according to the assignment), this makes the website user friendly in terms of making blog posts and its content more available.


Built With

The site is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It gets its blog post content from a Wordpress API. The content in the Wordpress API is put there by using Local.
The content of the blog posts are original titles that go with the chosen theme, the text is lorem ipsum, and the images are all from Unsplash. 
I worked in vsCode when building the project, and used GitHub to keep up with changes and versions. 
The site is not deployed to Netlify, as the repo is greated by Noroff and was not available through their website.


Getting Started
Installing and Running

The site can be viewed by using Live Server, when the files has been downloaded from GitHub. However the contents kept in the Wordpress API can only be accessed with the export zip from Local.
